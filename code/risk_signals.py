"""
Deterministic risk signals — shared between the runtime pipeline
(code/main.py) and the dataset label generator (scripts/generate_dataset.py).

Sharing this module between the two is intentional, not circular: it
computes FEATURES (evidence sufficiency, amount anomaly, merchant repeat
pattern), never the final decision. The runtime pipeline hands these
features to the LLM as pre-computed facts (so the model isn't reinventing
evidence-matching from raw text — see the brief's "deterministic signals
computed in code, not in the prompt" principle); the label generator uses
the same features as inputs to its own separate decision rule.

The decision rule itself (which combines these features into a ground-truth
contest/accept_liability/manual_review label) lives ONLY in
scripts/generate_dataset.py — deliberately not importable from here, so
code/main.py has no code path that could ever consult it. That's what
keeps this non-circular: the model never sees the answer, only the
features a human-written rubric also happens to use.
